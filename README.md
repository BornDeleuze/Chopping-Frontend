Chopping is a web game built in Javascript, with Rails as a backend API.
The point of the game is to chop as much wood as you can before sasquatch eats you.

The repo for the backend API can be found here
https://github.com/BornDeleuze/Chopping-Backend

To run the game, run the server for the backend with "rails s" and this app with "npx serve". Then in browser navigate to localhost:5000. 

All graphics made in the the premier graphic suite MS paint.

Good luck, have fun!
