Chopping is a web game built in Javascript, with Rails as a backend API.

This game can be found at https://chopping.netlify.app/
The backend is spund down on inactivity so it takes a bit to build and connect :0

The point of the game is to chop as much wood as you can before sasquatch eats you.
It was my first Javascript project, so take it easy on me ;)

The repo for the backend API can be found here
https://github.com/BornDeleuze/Chopping-Backend

To run the game, run the server for the backend with "rails s" and this app with "npx serve". Then in browser navigate to localhost:5000. 

All graphics made in the the premier graphic suite MS paint.

Good luck, have fun!
